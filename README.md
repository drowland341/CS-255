These documents (Business Requirements Document, System Design Document) exemplify my proficiency in system analysis and design, illustrating my ability to gather requirements from clients and devise systems that meet their needs effectively.

Reflection

Brief Summary of the DriverPass Project: DriverPass aimed to address the need for improved driver training, particularly for individuals preparing for driving tests at the DMV. The client envisioned a comprehensive system offering online classes, practice tests, on-the-road training, and management of driving lesson reservations.

Strengths: One aspect I excelled in was interpreting and translating user needs into concrete system requirements. This involved conducting thorough interviews and analysis to ensure alignment with the client's objectives.

Area for Revision: If I could revise one part of my work, it would be to enhance the clarity and organization of the system design document. Strengthening the presentation of diagrams and technical details would improve understanding and usability for stakeholders.

User-Centric Design: Understanding and addressing the user's needs are paramount in system design as it ensures that the final product is intuitive, functional, and tailored to meet user expectations. Incorporating user feedback throughout the design process helps create systems that genuinely serve their intended purpose

Approach to Software Design: My approach to software design involves a combination of thorough requirements gathering, iterative design cycles, and continuous stakeholder engagement. Techniques such as use case analysis, prototyping, and feedback loops are integral to my design process, facilitating the creation of robust and user-friendly systems.
